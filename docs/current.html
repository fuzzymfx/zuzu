<p><a href="/reading.html">Here’s what I am reading and writing these days</a></p>
<p>Happy New Year, muchachos! I hope you had a good one. I just returned to Bangalore after a much-needed break in my hometown. Leaving home and returning to the city was a bit of a bummer, but such is life! The dreaded omicron variant is wreaking havoc in the city. I am starting a new career at RadiusAI as a Software Engineer, and I am pretty stoked :D</p>
<p>At Radius AI I am involved in building an async uptime monitoring service using Rust, and also a concurrent heartbeat service in Python. I will update this page with more details soon.</p>
<p>Here’s an improved version of Llama Index’s sub-querying engine used to generate SQL from Natural Language: <a href="/blog/neak.html">Neak</a>.</p>
<p>Coming onto Dough: a rich, modular, and customisable content generator, crafted in Rust, <a href="https://anubhavp.dev/blog/dough.html">here’s everything</a> you need to know.
This is a breakdown of the tasks I was working on:</p>
<p>v2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving the rendering engine:
<ul>
<li><s>Add a refresh feature while rendering slides</s>
<ul>
<li>Hot Module Reload( FIX )</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><s>Add support for rendering <strong>nested syntax</strong></s></li>
<li>Add support for the maximum width and height of the terminal. Write a word wrapper.</li>
<li><s>Address the color storage issue for multiline elements, ensuring ANSI escape sequences are properly stripped: Refine color correction post-alignment</s></li>
<li>Enhance rendering for complex markdown elements like links within headings or lists.
<ul>
<li><s>lists.</s></li>
<li>blockquotes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provide comprehensive support for common Markdown elements.
<ul>
<li><s>Improve the rendering of thematic breaks</s></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><s>Improve the design language.</s></li>
<li>Image support for terminals with image capabilities is pending. <em>(Kitty, iTerm2, etc.)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><s>Syntax Highlighting in code blocks</s>
<ul>
<li><s>Improve the performance of syntax highlighting. The current implementation is CPU intensive. Use a different library for syntax highlighting, or parallel threads to improve performance.</s></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><s>Custom text alignment: A regex match for individual text alignment</s>
<ul>
<li><s>Improve the alignment of segments of text.</s></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><s>Implement running code blocks on separate threads and displaying results in the current console.</s></li>
</ul>
<p>I am done with most of what I had planned for Dough. Check out the entire <a href="https://github.com/fuzzymfx/dough/blob/main/README.md#contributing">TODO list here</a>. I want peers to contribute to the pending issues making this a more robust open-source project.</p>
<p><strong>Feb</strong></p>
<p>On a personal trajectory, <a href="https://injuly.in">Srijan</a> and I have identified a pain point in the developer/ consumer tooling space. We are working on a solution to solve it. We are still in the early stages of the product, and I will be sharing more details soon. The codename for the project is <em>‘Hoid’</em>. Hoid has a lot of moving parts. I am focused on the market research now. I believe that tech has become a commodity. There isn’t anything that you cannot build using tech anymore. Money is in solving the right set of problems.</p>
<p>To give a sneak into Hoid, here are some of the things that I am working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>content recommendation engine</li>
<li>search engine using vectors</li>
<li>content aggregation</li>
<li>bookmarks, and TL;DR</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, I am exploring esoteric programming languages and also planning to build a distributed file system in Rust.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>, a platform for independent writers. I will be writing on substack as well. This <strong>does not change</strong> the fact that this will still be my primary blog.</p>
